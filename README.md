## Instructions

Clone a copy of this repository to your device so that you can develop it locally. When you finish, make sure to push your latest commit to GitHub Classroom. 

For this Lab, you will create a responsive signup form for a fictitious tech startup. For ease of use and legibility, we will be building several views: 

1. You will begin with the narrowest view (mobile view).

2. Write all the HTML form structure (see screenshot). Adding all the necessary form attributes.

3. Style the form to look like the screenshots (should relatively close). Paying attention to the layout of the from small to large screens. (all media conditions are written for you).

4. Validate your work and push your work to the github repo.

**Note:** 
- There is a screenshot for invalid/valid states - this would be excellent practice to use for your assignment. (use simple validation - as we did in the first form demo using validation). 

- In the screenshot - only valid state is shown, and is positioned absolutely to sit beside the label. You don't have to do this, but I do encourage you try. :). Flex those CSS positioning skills!

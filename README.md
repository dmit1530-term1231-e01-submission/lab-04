## Instructions

Clone a copy of this repository to your device so that you can develop it locally. When you finish, make sure to push your latest commit to GitHub Classroom. 

For this Lab, you will create a responsive signup form for a fictitious tech startup. For ease of use and legibility, we will be building several views: 

1. You will begin with the narrowest view (mobile view).

2. Next, you will write a media query that flexes the web form when there is enough room to render the inputs and labels side-by-side.

3. After, you will write a media query that swaps the background image  and flexes our form and marketing copy beside the image.  (already done)

4. Finally, you will write a media query that stops prevents the layout from growing beyond a certain width. 

However, before you begin, you must prepare your content. Your first task will be to write valid, semantic HTML;.
